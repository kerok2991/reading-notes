## Growth Midset
People who adopt a growth mindset think that even their most fundamental skills can be improved with commitment and effortâ€”brains and talent are just the beginning. This perspective fosters the passion of learning and resilience needed for outstanding success.
## Three reminders to stay in a growth mindset
1. Mistakes will happen, learn and grow from them
  - dont stress out about mistakes break the down, review, move on.
2. accept new challenges with a positive outlook
  - remember when facing a challenge do your best to overcome it that way you grow
3. to grow you need to benifit and learn from others 
  - take in peoples opinion as well as suggestion, apply.
